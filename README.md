# whoCame

This is an web app that can help during the taking roll process for whatever event.

It can be used in a summer camp as well in a classroom or other nature event.

The interface was built using Jquery Mobile so it makes it easy to navigate from whatever phone using just a web browser.

There is a demmo online you can see on [whocame.saintdominicsavio.org](whocame.saintdominicsavio.org), the pin code for all users is 0000
